```

Then, run:

```bash
pod install
```

### Using Swift Package Manager (SPM)

You can also integrate the library using Swift Package Manager. Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/helloooideeeeea/RealTimeCutVADLibrary.git", from: "1.0.9")
]
```

Or, add the URL directly through Xcode's **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency**.

## Usage

Import the library and set up VAD in your `ViewController`:

```swift
import RealTimeCutVADLibrary

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var vadManager: VADWrapper?

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Initialize VAD Manager
        vadManager = VADWrapper()

        // Set VAD delegate to receive callbacks
        vadManager?.delegate = self

        // Set Silero model version (v4 or v5). Version v5 is recommended.
        vadManager?.setSileroModel(.v5)

        // Calling setVADThreshold is optional. If not called, the recommended default values will be used.
        // vadManager?.setThresholdWithVadStartDetectionProbability(0.7,0.7,0.5,0.95,10,57)

        // Set audio sample rate (8, 16, 24, or 48 kHz)
        vadManager?.setSamplerate(.SAMPLERATE_48)

        // Retrieve audio channel data from Microphone
        guard let channelData = buffer.floatChannelData else {
            return
        }

        // Extract frame length from the audio buffer
        let frameLength = UInt(buffer.frameLength)

        // Select the first channel as mono audio data
        let monoralData = channelData[0] // This is UnsafeMutablePointer<Float>

        // Send the audio data directly to VAD processing
        vadManager?.processAudioData(withBuffer: monoralData, count: frameLength)

        // ❌ Deprecated Usage. Do NOT use this method: Slow due to NSNumber conversion
        var monoralDataArray: [NSNumber] = []
        for i in 0..<frameLength {
            monoralDataArray.append(NSNumber(value: monoralData[i]))
        }
        // ⚠️ Deprecated method call
        vadManager?.processAudioData(monoralDataArray)
}

extension ViewController: VADDelegate {
    // Called when voice activity starts
    func voiceStarted() {
        print("Voice detected!")
    }

    // Called when voice activity ends, providing WAV data at 16 kHz
    // The Data object includes the WAV file header metadata, making it ready for playback or saving directly.
    func voiceEnded(withWavData wavData: Data!) {
        print("Voice ended. WAV data length: \(wavData.count) bytes")
    }

    // 🆕 Called in real-time with each chunk of PCM float audio data during voice activity
    // This data is 32-bit float, mono, 16 kHz, and can be concatenated for file output or streamed live.
    // ⚠️ Make sure to handle this on a background thread, as processing in real-time on the main thread may lead to dropped audio or UI freeze.
    // For testing, save the concatenated PCM data and convert to WAV using sox:
    // $ sox -t raw -r 16000 -c 1 -e float -b 32 test_16khz_32bit.pcm test_16khz_32bit.wav
    func voiceDidContinue(withPCMFloat pcmFloatData: Data!) {
        print("voiceDidContinue")
        // ex. private let pcmDataQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.pcmDataQueue")
        pcmDataQueue.async { [weak self] in
            guard let self = self, let data = pcmFloatData else { return }
            self.collectedPCMData.append(data)
        }
    }
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Sample Rates
You can set the audio sample rate using `setSamplerate`:

- `.SAMPLERATE_8`  (8 kHz)
- `.SAMPLERATE_16` (16 kHz)
- `.SAMPLERATE_24` (24 kHz)
- `.SAMPLERATE_48` (48 kHz)

### Silero Model Versions
Choose between Silero model versions:

- `.v4` - Silero Model Version 4
- `.v5` - Silero Model Version 5 (recommend)

### VAD Threshold Configuration
Customize VAD detection sensitivity with `setThresholdWithVadStartDetectionProbability`:

```swift
vadManager?.setThresholdWithVadStartDetectionProbability(
    0.7,  // Start detection probability threshold
    0.7,  // End detection probability threshold
    0.5,  // True positive ratio for voice start
    0.95, // False positive ratio for voice end
    10,   // Frames to confirm voice start (0.32s)
    57    // Frames to confirm voice end (1.824s)
)
```

### **Threshold Explanation**
- **Start detection probability threshold (0.7)**: The VAD model must predict speech probability above this threshold to trigger voice start.
- **End detection probability threshold (0.7)**: The VAD model must predict speech probability below this threshold to trigger voice end.
- **True positive ratio for voice start (0.5)**: 50% of frames in a given window must be speech for voice activity to begin.
- **False positive ratio for voice end (0.95)**: 95% of frames in a given window must be silence for voice activity to end.
- **Start frame count (10 frames ≈ 0.32s)**: Number of frames required to confirm voice activity.
- **End frame count (57 frames ≈ 1.824s)**: Number of frames required to confirm silence before stopping voice detection.

#### **Important Notes:**
- **Stricter VAD Detection in Silero v5**:
Based on observations, Silero v5 appears to apply a stricter VAD detection mechanism compared to v4. 

- **Differences in Speech Start Detection**:
In Silero v4, speech is considered to have started if, within 10 frames (0.32s), **80%** of the frames exceed a VAD probability of 70%.
In Silero v5, this condition is relaxed, and speech is considered started if **50%** of the frames within 10 frames (0.32s) exceed a VAD probability of 70%.
Adjusting Sensitivity for Voice Activity Detection
If you need to fine-tune the sensitivity of voice segmentation, use the following function to customize the thresholds:

```swift
vadManager?.setThresholdWithVadStartDetectionProbability(<#T##Float#>, 
    vadEndDetectionProbability: <#T##Float#>, 
    voiceStartVadTrueRatio: <#T##Float#>, 
    voiceEndVadFalseRatio: <#T##Float#>, 
    voiceStartFrameCount: <#T##Int32#>, 
    voiceEndFrameCount: <#T##Int32#>)
```
By adjusting these parameters, you can fine-tune the strictness of voice segmentation to better suit your application needs.
- **Silero v5 Performance**:
The performance of Silero model v5 may vary, and adjusting the thresholds might be necessary to achieve optimal results. There are also discussions on this topic, such as [this one](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper/issues/934#issuecomment-2439340290).

## Algorithm Explanation

### ONNX Runtime for Silero VAD
This library leverages **ONNX Runtime (C++)** to run the Silero VAD models efficiently. By utilizing ONNX Runtime, the library achieves high-performance inference across different platforms (iOS/macOS), ensuring fast and accurate voice activity detection.

### Why Use WebRTC's Audio Processing Module (APM)?
This library utilizes WebRTC's APM for several key reasons:

- **High-pass Filtering**: Removes low-frequency noise.
- **Noise Suppression**: Reduces background noise for clearer voice detection.
- **Gain Control**: Adaptive digital gain control enhances audio levels.
- **Sample Rate Conversion**: Silero VAD requires a sample rate of 16 kHz, and APM ensures conversion from other sample rates (8, 24, or 48 kHz).

### Audio Processing Workflow

1. **Input Audio Configuration**: The library supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 24 kHz, and 48 kHz.
2. **Audio Preprocessing**:
   - The audio is split into chunks based on the sample rate.
   - APM processes these chunks with filters and gain adjustments.
   - Audio is converted to 16 kHz for Silero VAD compatibility.

3. **Voice Activity Detection**:
   - The processed audio chunks are passed to Silero VAD.
   - VAD outputs a probability score indicating voice activity.

4. **Algorithm for Voice Detection**:
   - **Voice Start Detection**: When the VAD probability exceeds the threshold, a pre-buffer stores audio frames to capture speech onset.
   - **Voice End Detection**: Once silence is detected over a set number of frames, recording stops, and the audio is output as WAV data.

5. **Output**:
   - The resulting audio data is provided as WAV with a sample rate of 16 kHz.

### WebRTC APM Configuration

The following configurations are applied to optimize voice detection:

```cpp
config.gain_controller1.enabled = true;
config.gain_controller1.mode = webrtc::AudioProcessing::Config::GainController1::kAdaptiveDigital;
config.gain_controller2.enabled = true;
config.high_pass_filter.enabled = true;
config.noise_suppression.enabled = true;
config.transient_suppression.enabled = true;
config.voice_detection.enabled = false;
```
